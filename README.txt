I am desperately trying to figure out how to use github with vscode. 

Doing things from scratch while following a tutorial seems to help.

Now i just have to figure out how to get it working with my other existing projects.

So what's the difference between pull and push anyway?

I think pushing is what publishes the changes to the repository.
